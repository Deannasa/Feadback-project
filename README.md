This data contains measurement results of an electrical potential measured by an electromyograph (EMG) device, in the biceps muscles. The subjects in the control group did not receive encouragement before measuring their electrical potential, while those in the treatment groups received positive reinforcement ("you are looking great") or negative ("you are not trying hard"). I am interested to find if there is an effect of positive or negative reinforcement on the electrical potential measured in the biceps muscle.
